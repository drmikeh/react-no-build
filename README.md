# React with No Build Tools

This is a simple example of using React without any build tools. I do recommend using modern build tools but for educational and experimental purposes, it's nice to be able to spin up a simple React app without a build process.

You can run the demo [here](https://drmikeh.github.io/react-no-build/).
